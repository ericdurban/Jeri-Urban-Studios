        <hr style="color: black; width: 60%; margin: auto;">

        <!-- 1ST QUESTION -->
        <h2>Do you teach any other instrument? </h2>
        <p>Just piano and flute. </p>

        <!-- 2ND QUESTION -->
        <h2>Do you teach adults? </h2>
        <p>Yes.</p>

        <!-- 3RD QUESTION -->
        <h2> Is piano or flute the right instrument for my child?</h2>
        <p>Often it is the relationship with the teacher and the experience 
        of the sessions are that are more important for the child than the specific 
        instrument. I prioritize building great relationships with families and 
        creating the optimal learning experience for each student. I am focused 
        on making sessions engaging, fun, and have realistic expectations for each 
        age group. And a great foundation in music is transferable to any 
        instrument!
        </p>
        <p><span class="important">I am a strong believer in private sessions even if the student is already 
          in band or an ensemble.</span> Private sessions will greatly enhance all the skills 
          that public schools offer, not to mention the level of detail one on one sessions 
          offer are hard to compare to a big group session.
        </p>

        <!-- 4TH QUESTION -->
        <h2>What kind of flute should I purchase?</h2>
        <p>There are several different models to choose from. <span class="important">I will help you through 
          the process of finding the right instrument</span> according to your specific childâ€™s 
        age, level, and of course your budget. 
        </p>
        <p>Please look at the table below for a couple of options. </p>

        <!-- 5TH QUESTION -->
        <h2>How much do we have to practice?</h2>
        <p><span class="important">Practicing outside of session time is essential</span> for making progress on 
          the instrument. I want you to be successful and will help you to develop a good 
          practice routine!</p>
        <p>My goal for the students is to <span class="important">practice 20-30 minutes, 5 days a week.</span> They are 
          responsible for tracking their practice time and reporting it to me. A reward system is in place to acknowledge 
          the amount of practice completed.
