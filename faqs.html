        <h1>Questions?</h1>

        <h2>Do you teach any other instrument? </h2>
        <p>Just piano and flute. </p>

        <h2>Do you teach adults? </h2>
        <p>Yes.</p>

        <h2> Is piano or flute the right instrument for my child?</h2>
        <p>Often it is the relationship with the teacher and the experience 
        of the lessons are that are more important for the child than the specific 
        instrument. I prioritize building great relationships with families and 
        creating the optimal learning experience for each student. I am focused 
        on making lessons engaging, fun, and have realistic expectations for each 
        age group. And a great foundation in music is transferable to any 
        instrument! </p>

        <h2>What kind of flute should I purchase?</h2>
        <p>If your child is younger than 8 or 9 years old, the full size flute is 
        usually too big, so a flute with a curved headjoint is recommended. This shortens 
        the reach and makes it possible for young children to play comfortably. There 
        are several different brands and models to choose from. I will help you through 
        the process of finding the right instrument according to your specific childâ€™s 
        age, level, and of course your budget. </p>

        <h2>How much do we have to practice?</h2>
        <p>Practicing outside of lesson time is essential for making progress on 
        the instrument. I want you to be successful and will help you to develop a good 
        practice routine! I generally recommend that our young beginners start off with 
        10-15 minutes a couple days a week and work their way up. Students make a practice 
        list at the end of every lesson with their teacher and we have countless resources 
        available to help families make practice fun and enjoyable throughout the week! </p>
